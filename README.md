# Iris-Flower-Classification

# Data Acquisition

Obtain Dataset: Download the Iris dataset, which is commonly used for classification tasks. This dataset typically includes measurements of iris flowers such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, along with the species label.

# Data Preparation
Load Dataset: Import the Iris dataset into your working environment.
Inspect Data: Examine the dataset to understand its structure, including column names, data types, and the distribution of labels.
Clean Data: Check for and handle any missing values or anomalies in the dataset to ensure its quality.
Feature Selection: Identify which features (attributes) are relevant for the classification task.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualize Data: Create visualizations to explore the relationships between features and the target variable. Common plots include scatter plots, pair plots, and histograms to understand feature distributions and separability.
Statistical Analysis: Perform statistical analysis to gain insights into the data distributions and correlations between features.

# Feature Engineering
Normalize/Standardize Features: Prepare the data for modeling by scaling features if necessary. This step ensures that all features contribute equally to the model.
Encode Labels: Convert categorical labels into numerical format if required by the model.

# Model Training
Select Model: Choose a machine learning model suitable for classification, such as logistic regression, decision trees, or support vector machines.
Train Model: Fit the model to the training data, allowing it to learn the patterns that distinguish between the iris species.

# Model Evaluation
Predict: Use the trained model to make predictions on the test set or unseen data.
Evaluate: Assess the model’s performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Create a confusion matrix to visualize the classification results and identify areas of improvement.
Hyperparameter Tuning

# Optimize Model:
Adjust hyperparameters to improve model performance. Techniques such as grid search or random search can be used to find the best parameters for the model.
Documentation and Reporting

# Document Findings:
Summarize the model’s performance, insights gained from the analysis, and any notable patterns observed. Prepare a report that includes visualizations, evaluation metrics, and a discussion of results.
Create Visualizations: 
Design clear and informative charts to present your findings and model performance effectively.
Model Persistence

# Save Model: 
Store the trained model for future use. This allows you to deploy the model without retraining and apply it to new data as needed.
